whenever we run => npm install in any folder it looks for package.json
file in that folder and installas all packages mention in depencies

If we have to share project with anyone

we will remove nodes_modules other developer will run npm install

All code lies in src folder i.e. source code

All the assets (Images or icons) are stored in public folder
even index.html is also in public folder.

In a js file can we write html tag??

JSX ??
Javascript xml

It allows you to write html in js file

React provides you component based structure
What is component ?

Whatever you see is a component

view/html => component

Technically returned html is a component

So wehen function returns html it becomes component

How to create COMPONENT :
Create a function and return view/html
And export that function

//Component first letter should be Capital
//Than use that exported component as html tag in app.js and import in the app.js

Reusing a component => we can use that component tag multiple times


In React All the html tags must be closed
eg : <input/>

In general cake component should be designed in such a manner that it should show diffrent
show different data every times
It will recieve data as i/p

whenever we want to pass data as input to a component we use a mechanism known as props

props ???
<component name="something" price="something" image="something"/>

all the above 3 things passed to that component are known as 
passing the props.

How do we call functions in React

//eventname  = {handlerfunction}

js events onclick , onchange, etc...

How do we Create Component???
=> By creating a function and by export , those are known as 
=> Functional/stateless components.

State full components => which are class based

props is an object which can't be chnaged , Functional components can't be changed.

class based components have their state

state is an Object.

In layment terms state is data at some point of time.

State will only initialize at once and than it will be update.

if we initialize state = {onlineusers:0}

this.state = {} => will only initialize at once 

Updation or state
this.setstate() => if we want to update state or change state value // it is used to udate the screen

State of component or class based component provide us several life cycle methods

which at various stages invoked automatically telling us that component has reach that stage

we cant update the functional component
** React Hooks **
=> some methods which provides state feature to functional component
If anything we want to change;
and change can only happen when state is changing

we can use the state in function component also using Hooks
usestate() //method ehich provide state feature

**Conditional rendering means rendering some element based on the Conditional
eg I want lavel to render if and only when user has some value

***<Link>***
for all element whatever element you click want to go somewhere
wrap that element in <link> tag //It is available in Router packagewe tell link tag the path
